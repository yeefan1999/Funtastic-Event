# Funtastic-Event

This repo showed the Final Year Project. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Ajax were used for the development of this project.

This is a website designed for customers to hold their desired events by choosing a theme, service from the websites. There are two systems developed for this project as an admin system and user system. User will be able to do online purchase and view, where a user profile is provided for their purchase histories and status tracking. Admin will be able to update and manage the websites from time to time and send subscription email.

You will need to have a database (using XAMPP) for the connection purpose.
